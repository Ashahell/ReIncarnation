# MIDI interop ledger (R1+, owner decisions pending)

Rows here are E0 defaults picked for E1-silent points (owner preference
`owner-pragmatic-e0-defaults`): one recommended default each, named
constant in code, pinned by a host test, revisit note attached. Shipped
behavior is opt-in and off by default wherever a Classic/power-mode
decision is pending.

## M1: follower spec conformance (2026-10-08)

- **SPP while running: count and ignore** (`midi_follow.c`, counter
  `struct RIFollow.spp_ignored`, law pinned in t125/t126). The MIDI 1.0
  spec intends SPP to arrive only while stopped; Live in Song mode
  follows that. If an SPP arrives mid-take the follower emits no intent
  and bumps the counter instead of cueing a locate under a running
  transport. Revisit (owner decision D2/D4): if SMF mapping (R7) or
  recorded-take history ever needs mid-take SPP, define the cue point
  (next bar? next beat?) and the counter becomes the audit trail.
- **Start/Continue fire on the next F8** (armed state `play_arm`,
  t125/t126). One clock (~20 ms at 120 BPM) later than the status byte,
  per MIDI 1.0 "Syncing Sequence Playback". Not an E0 choice (spec
  mandates it); recorded so a future "start on FA" regression reads as
  a spec violation, not a judgment call.
- **Dropout ends a pending arm** (`midi_follow_poll` clears `play_arm`;
  a new take needs a new Start). E0: the spec is silent on arms across
  silence. Revisit if a master is found that sends FA once and clocks
  much later.
